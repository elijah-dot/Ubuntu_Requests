# Ubuntu_Requests

## Overview
Ubuntu_Requests is a Python library that simplifies making HTTP requests and logging their results on Ubuntu systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for sending requests (GET, POST, etc.) and records request/response details for debugging and auditing purposes. The modular design allows for straightforward integration into other Python projects.

## Features
- Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to any endpoint.
- Custom logging utility to track requests and responses.
- Error handling for network and HTTP issues.
- Easily extensible and modular codebase.
- Compatible with Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- Ubuntu or compatible Linux environment
